tool sniffer set streaming-enabled=yes streaming-server=192.168.1.100
/tool sniffer set filter-interface wlan1,wlan2
/tool sniffer set filter-ip-address 192.168.1.150/32

streaming-enabled – enables forwarding of packets.
streaming-server – IP address of the host where the Wireshark is running.
filter-interface – interface(s) where the capture will happen. (In my case, I have two radios 2,4 GHz & 5 GHz and I selected both)
filter-ip-address – you can limit the sniffing to only a specific IP address(es). 
Start the capture:

/tool sniffer start
Review the sniffer status:
